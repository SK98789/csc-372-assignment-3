            <section>
                <p>
                    Hello, food enthusiasts! I'm here today to investigate and promote restaurants in the heart of
                    Greensboro. This time, I will be examining many places near the University of North Carolina at
                    Greensboro as well
                    as North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. I know that college students will be
                    looking
                    for places that are quick, cheap, walkable, and, of course, delicious. In my investigation, I have
                    found several
                    such locations and the ones I recommend the most I will be highlighting below. Let's get right into
                    it!
                </p>

                I only go by my internet name, Not-So-Traveling, as I am definitely a real person with real opinions.
